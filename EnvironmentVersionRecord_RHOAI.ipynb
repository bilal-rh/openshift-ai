    "## Best Practice: Clearing Outputs Before Committing\n",
    "\n",
    "Before committing the notebook to a version control system like Git, it's advisable to clear all outputs. This practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reduces File Size:** Makes the repository smaller and faster to clone.\n",
    "- **Maintains Privacy:** Prevents accidental sharing of output data that might contain sensitive information.\n",
    "- **Improves Clarity:** Keeps the repository focused on the code rather than transient results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps to Clear Outputs in JupyterLab:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open the Notebook:** Navigate to and open the notebook `EnvironmentVersionRecord_RHOAI.ipynb`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Clear Outputs:** From the menu, select **Edit** > **Clear Outputs All Cells**. This command will remove all cell outputs in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Save Notebook:** After clearing the outputs, save the notebook. You can do this by:\n",
    "   - Selecting **File** > **Save Notebook**\n",
    "   - Or by using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + S` (or `Cmd + S` on macOS).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   This ensures that when you commit the notebook, it will save without any executed outputs, preserving a clean state for future users or for yourself when you check out this version later."
